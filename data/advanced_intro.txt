The Ancient Agora of Classical Athens was an area of political gatherings and commercial transactions, the locus of the administration and of justice, a religious and intellectual centre. The agora is already mentioned in Homer’s epics, and represents, therefore, a constituent element of the ancient Greek city. The Agora covers a rather large area NW of the Acropolis, demarcated by the Areios Pagos on the south, the river Heridanos on the north and by the hillock of Agoraios Kolonos on the west.
